# Readme of a6-tester Platform based on Arduino Nano


## [1.0 - 2021-06-02]
The A6-Tester is made to drive and read all A6 I/Os.
It is powered by via HDSub15 Connector from the A6 Module.

It can also generate Sensorfaults or different levels of Eddy Current Signals (both Receivers) by adding or removing resistors between drv+ and drv-
Have a look at the circuit diagram.

The board as also 3 Push buttons and a LCD attached to it.
So it can be used for other purposes as well.

Circuit Diagramm will be moved to Altium Live somewhen. Remember to update the Link
